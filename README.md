# Procedural-Maze
This Repo is for my games engines 1 project

This is a game that will procedurally generate a maze as the player goes on, allowing the user to navigate a randomly generated maze, accumulating score the longer they survive. The complexity of the maze increases overtime, as well as increasing the speed of the camera and the player. Once the player falls out of sight of the camera, the game is over. The game is played by clicking a location with the mouse that the player will travel to using automated path finding
